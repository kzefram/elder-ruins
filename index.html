            <p>Welcome to Elder Ruins RPG! A game where you can go on a wild adventure into the ruins of The Elder City and fight fantastical beasts. Join us on this quest to kill the king of the dragons, humble adventurer!</p>

            <p>On this adventure we are walking through a dense forest when we come upon some ruins. As we are searching this vast expanse of beautiful site, we can see that a lot of people must have lived long ago. An epic battle must have taken place here for all the buildings to be distroyed like this.</p>

            <p>We see a pile of supplies and a path. Oh look at the castle in the distance. It looks like the king of the dragons is waiting for us. What will we do?</p>
